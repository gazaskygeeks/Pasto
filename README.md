# Order breakfast/lunch

We always get food late and sometimes have no choice. The super app of Hani didn't really work, let's help him. Build a website where everyday we can oder breakfast and lunch. When visiting it the user should see a form with a time deadline. Each order is saved on a Google Sheet and at a specific time, 10:00am for breakfast and 02:00pm for lunch. The breakfast Orders will be sent to Hani1, and the lunch Orders will be sent to Hani2 on the phone as an SMS.
